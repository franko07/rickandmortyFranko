# Rick And Morty App 🚀

Welcome to the Henry integrative project repository! Inspired by the famous TV series Rick and Morty, this application allows users to search for characters from the entire series, add them to favorites, view character details, and more.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Character Search:** You can search for characters by their identification number from the search bar. Additionally, there's a "Random" button that generates a random character.

- **Character Details:** View the characteristics of each character along with their image.

- **Favorites:** You can select your favorite characters. In the favorites view, you have the option to filter in ascending and descending order, as well as by the characters' status. You can also remove characters you no longer want in your favorites.

- **Registration Form:** I have created a properly validated login form for you to access the application.
